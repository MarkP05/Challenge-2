# Github GUI Application

## Summary of the Application
### This application displays a frame that contains 3 text boxes and a submit button. The app will use input to get a path on your local files, a repo name, and a token. The application will make the project on your computer, create the necessary git files, and upload a repo to github. You will then recieve a link to the new repository.

## How to Run as a Developer
### The external libraries used in the application are java.io.*, java.awt.*, and javax.swing.* which all come with java. Newer versions of java are recommended but the minimum JDK required is java version 6 which can be found here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-java-archive-javase6-downloads.html. Git must also be installed in your systems path. Windows Git Install: https://git-scm.com/downloads. Mac Git Install: https://brew.sh/. Lastly, you need a java IDE to run the .java programs.
